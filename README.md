# Leaegue-of-Legends-Team-Win-With-CSV-Data-with-EDA-ML-DL-using-tensorflow-keras-sklearn-in-python


This is a very comprehensive clean python code for league of legends game winning team predictions through the first 10 minutes of the game
this dataset contains some statistics of each game during the 1st 10 minutes and whether a team will win or not

what was done is
explanatory data analysis on 10_000 Diamond Ranked League of legends dataset with helpful insights for feature selection and dimensionality reduction
along with training machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine {SVM}, ensemble of random forest classifiers) and deep learning models {ANN or what may be known as Dense Neural Networks} with outstanding results.

The data is provided in the file high_diamond_ranked_10min.csv
the python code is available in the "League of Legends Team Win Classification Clean Code.ipynb" file as a jupyter notebook file extension.
